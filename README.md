## ``` Notes ```

The Makefile contains all the required targets, but you might want to extend their behavior.

Very basic skelettons of receiver and sender source files are present, have a look to understand how you can enable logging or not.

A very simple test case is present, you probably want to update it.

And finally, if this message is still there at your final submission, it looks like you forgot to provide a proper README.
